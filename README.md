## Next Steps

1. User Profiles. As a user, I would like the ability to create and edit my user profile and be able to link multiple users to the same menu.

2. Responsiveness. I would like the app to look good on desktop, tablet, and mobile platforms.

3. Render Menu To QR Code. As a user, I would like to click a button to render a menu to a page that is accesible by patrons of the restauraunt, and for that menu to dynamically change based on my input.

4. 86 product. As a user, I would like to have checkboxes or switches to mark an item as available or unavailable. If unavailable the item would not render to the guest menu.

5. Food/Drink Pairings. As a user, I would like to have a separate beverage menu, and be able to link drinks with certain menu items for pairings and upselling.

6. Custom CSS templates. As a user, I would like to have a selection of CSS templates to personalize the visitor menu. I would like a drop down list and an example of each CSS template.
